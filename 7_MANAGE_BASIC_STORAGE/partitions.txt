PARTITIONS 
Disk partitioning divides a hard drive into multiple logical storage partitions.You can use partitions to divide storage based on different requirements, and this division provides many benefits.

MBR PARTITION SCHEME
The Master Boot Record (MBR) partitioning scheme is the standard on systems that run BIOS firmware.
It supports max 4 primary partitions. With extended and logical partitions, you can create up to 15 partitions.

Since these limitations, these scheme is superseded by GPT scheme.

GPT SCHEME (GUID Partition Table)
It supports max 128 primary partitions.

There are different partition editors:
parted, standard editor
fdisk, (changes are saved after command w)
gdisk, interactive
web console, easyer
ansible, on a large scale
