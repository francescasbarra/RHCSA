CREATE AND MOUNT FILE SYSTEM

mkfs = make file system

mkfs.xfs(or ext4) /dev/vdb1
#to create the fs for the partition

TO MOUNT THE FS WE HAVE TO CREATE A MOUNT POINT (DIRECTORY WERE THE FS IS AVAILABLE)
mkdir /mnt

THEN WE HAVE TO MOUNT THE FS ON THAT MOUNTPOINT 
mount /mnt

IMPORTANT
When the system reoot it doesn't mount again the file system automatically.
TO MOUNT THE FS PERSISTENTLY WE HAVE TO ADD THE PARTITION IN THE /etc/fstab FILE:
vim /etc/fstab
ADD THE ENTRY FOR THE NEW PARTITIONS AND FS:
UUID=...uuid for the partition..... /mnt (mountpoint) xfs (fs type) defaults 0 0
UUID=................ /mnt xfs defaults 0 0

Important 
AFTER UPDATING FSTAB WE HAVE TO RESTART THE DAEMON SYSTEMD
systemctl restart daemon reload
