parted /dev/vdb print

MBR PARTITONS

parted /dev/vdb
#it open an interactive partition session

(parted) mkpart #subcommand to create a primary or extended partition
(parted) partition type? primary or extendend
(parted) file system type? xfs or ext4
(parted) size start 2048s
(parted) size end 1000MB
(parted) quit

#As an alternative to interactive mode, you can create a partition in a single command:
parted /dev/vdb mkpart primary xfs 2048s 1000MB



GPT PARTITIONS
You have to use the same steps but instead to choose between primary/extended you have to set a name for the partitions.
In a single command:
parted /dev/vdb mkpart part1 xfs 2048s 1000M

Important
When you provide the end position, the parted command updates the partition table on the disk with the new partition details.
IMPORTANT
Once you create the partition you have to use the command
udevadm settle
to register/save the partition

TO REMOVE PARTITION
check with parted /dev/vdb print the numer of the partition and then remove
parted /dev/vdb1 rm 1
