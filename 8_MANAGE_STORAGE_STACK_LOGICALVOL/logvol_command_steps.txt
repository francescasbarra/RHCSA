CREATE A LOGICAL VOLUME

1 Determine the physical devices that are used for creating physical volumes, and initialize these devices as LVM physical volumes.
Create partitions or if you already have them initialize them as PHYSICAL VOLUME (you can initialize more partitions on the same command).

pvcreate /dev/vdb1 /dev/vdb2



2 Create a volume group from multiple physical volumes.

vgcreate vg_name /dev/vdb1 /dev/vdb2
