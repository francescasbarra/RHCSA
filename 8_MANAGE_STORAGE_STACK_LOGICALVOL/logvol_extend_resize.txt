EXTEND AND REDUCE LVM STORAGE

After creating a logical volume, you can extend the volume to expand the file system. You might need to extend PV or VG to increase the storage capacity of the LV.


to add other partitions to the volume group:

vgextend vg_name /dev/vdb3

-----------------------

to extend a logical volume

lvextend -L 500M /dev/vg_name/lv_name

-----------------------

to extend the fs to LV dimension

xfs_growfs /mountpoint

for ext4 fs the procedure is the same to increase size
to reduce size you have to write:
resize2fs /dev/vg_name/lv_name

-----------------------
