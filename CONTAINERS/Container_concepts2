You need a Red Hat Developer account to download an image from the Red Hat registries.

podman login
to authenticate to the registries. 
#If you do not provide a registry URL to the podman login command, then it authenticates to the default configured registry.

#[user@host ~]$ podman login registry.lab.example.com
Username: RH134
Password: EXAMPLEPASSWORD
Login Succeeded!

------------------

podman login --get-login
To verify that you are logged in to a registry

#[user01@rhel-vm ~]$ podman login registry.access.redhat.com --get-login
RH134
[user01@rhel-vm ~]$ podman login quay.io --get-login
Error: not logged into quay.io

CONFIGURE CONTAINER REGISTRIES

Important The default configuration file for container registries is the /etc/containers/registries.conf file.

#If you do not specify the fully qualified name of the container image when using podman commands, then the list of registries in the unqualified-search-registries section of this file is used to search for the container image.

#[user@host ~]$ podman pull ubi
#If you do specify the fully qualified name of the container image from the command line, then the container utility does not search in this section. The unqualified-search-registries section can be left blank to ensure that you use the fully qualified name of the container image.

#[user@host ~]$ podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest

-----------------

Configure settings for container registries in the [[registry]] sections of the file. Use a separate [[registry]] section to configure settings for each container registry.

#[[registry]]
location = "registry.lab.example.com"
insecure = true
blocked = false
The location setting specifies the location of the container registry.

#If the insecure setting is set to true, then you can use unencrypted HTTP as well as TLS connections with untrusted certificates to access the registry.

#If the blocked setting is set to true, then images cannot be downloaded from that registry.

Container Files to Build Container Images
A container file is a text file with the instructions to build a container image. 
A container file usually has a context that defines the path or URL where its files and directories are located. 
The resulting container image consists of read-only layers, where each layer represents an instruction from the container file.

The following output is an example of a container file that uses the UBI image from the registry.access.redhat.com registry, installs the python3 package, and prints the hello string to the console.

#[user@host ~]$ cat Containerfile
#FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
#RUN dnf install -y python3
#CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "echo hello"]
