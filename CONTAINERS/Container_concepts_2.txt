You need a Red Hat Developer account to download an image from the Red Hat registries.

podman login 
to authenticate to the registries. If you do not provide a registry URL to the podman login command, then it authenticates to the default configured registry.

[user@host ~]$ podman login registry.lab.example.com
Username: RH134
Password: EXAMPLEPASSWORD
Login Succeeded!

--------------------

podman login registry --get-login
To verify that you are logged in to a registry

[user01@rhel-vm ~]$ podman login registry.access.redhat.com --get-login
RH134
[user01@rhel-vm ~]$ podman login quay.io --get-login
Error: not logged into quay.io

--------------------

Configure Container Registries
The default configuration file for container registries is the /etc/containers/registries.conf file.

If you do not specify the fully qualified name of the container image when using podman commands, then the list of registries in the unqualified-search-registries section of this file is used to search for the container image.

[user@host ~]$ podman pull ubi
If you do specify the fully qualified name of the container image from the command line, then the container utility does not search in this section. The unqualified-search-registries section can be left blank to ensure that you use the fully qualified name of the container image.

[user@host ~]$ podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest

-------------------

Configure settings for container registries in the [[registry]] sections of the file. Use a separate [[registry]] section to configure settings for each container registry.

[[registry]]
location = "registry.lab.example.com"
insecure = true
blocked = false
The location setting specifies the location of the container registry.

If the insecure setting is set to true, then you can use unencrypted HTTP as well as TLS connections with untrusted certificates to access the registry.

If the blocked setting is set to true, then images cannot be downloaded from that registry.
