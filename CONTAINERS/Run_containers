RUN CONTAINERS
Once you have the container images you can use them to run containers.

CONTAINER STATES:

- CREATED : a container that is created but is not started.

- RUNNING : a container that is running with its processes.

- STOPPED : a container with its processes stopped.

- PAUSED : a container with its processes paused. Not supported for rootless containers.

- DELETED : a container with its processes in a dead state.
