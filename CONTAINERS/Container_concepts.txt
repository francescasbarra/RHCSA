Containers
A container is a running istance of a container image.
It is a set up of one or more processes that are isolated from the rest of the system.
A Linux container is an isolated environment that allows applications to run with all their dependencies, but without using a full virtual machine. It utilizes the resources of the host operating system, making it lighter and faster than a virtual machine.


VM vs Containers

VM
-Enables multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single hardware platform.
-Uses a hypervisor to divide hardware into multiple virtual hardware systems.
-Requires a complete operating system environment to support the application.
-Virtual machines have their own complete operating system, so they are heavier.
-Virtual machines require more time and resources since they emulate an entire computer.
-Virtual machines are fully isolated, with their own operating system and kernel.

CONTAINERS
-Containers share the kernel of the host operating system, so they are lighter.
-Containers start and run faster because they use fewer resources.
-Containers isolate applications but share the kernel.
-Runs directly on the host operating system, and it shares resources with all containers on the system.
-Shares the host's kernel, but it isolates the application processes from the rest of the system.
-Requires far fewer hardware resources than virtual machines, so containers are also quicker to start.


Rootless and Rootful Containers
On the container host, you can run containers as the root user or as a regular, unprivileged user. Containers that a privileged user runs are called rootful containers. Containers that non-privileged users run are called rootless containers.

Container Management Tools
Red Hat Enterprise Linux provides a set of container tools that you can use to run containers in a single server:
-podman manages containers and container images.
-skopeo inspects, copies, deletes, and signs images.
-buildah creates container images.
