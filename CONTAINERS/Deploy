The Podman Utility
Podman is a tool to manage containers. 
The podman utility does not use a daemon to function, and so developers do not need a privileged user account on the system to start or stop containers. Podman provides many subcommands to interact with containers and images. 
The following list shows subcommands that are used in this section:

podman build #Build a container image with a container file.
podman run #Run a command in a new container.
podman images	#List images in local storage.
podman ps #Print information about containers.
podman inspect	#Display configuration of a container, image, volume, network, or pod.
podman pull #Download an image from a registry.
podman cp	#Copy files or directories between a container and the local file system.
podman exec #Execute a command in a running container.
podman rm	#Remove one or more containers.
podman rmi	#Remove one or more locally stored images.
podman search	#Search a registry for an image.
