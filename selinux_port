add and enable port 82 to httpd

check in the file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf the entry "Listen"
set Listen=82

after change RESTART  httpd.service
systemctl restart httpd.service


semanage port -l | http
to check the ports of the context http_port_t

semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 82
to add port 82 to context http_port_t

check again by listing with semanage port -l ...

then restart and enable httpd service
systemctl restart httpd.service
systemctl enable --now httpd.service

to check httpd is serving on port 82
curl localhost:82


To delete the port
semanage port -d -t http_port_t -p tcp 82


Important before adding the port with semanage we can also add it permanently to the firewall

firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=82/tcp
firewall-cmd --reload
firewall-cmd --list-all  #to check
