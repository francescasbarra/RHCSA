Select a Target at Runtime

On a running system, administrators can switch to a different target by using the systemctl isolate command.

[root@host ~]# systemctl isolate multi-user.target

Isolating a target stops all services that the target does not require (and its dependencies), and starts any required services that are not yet started.
