SELECT A TARGET AT RUNTIME

On a running system, administrators can switch to a different target by using the systemctl isolate command.

[root@host ~]# systemctl isolate multi-user.target

Isolating a target stops all services that the target does not require (and its dependencies), and starts any required services that are not yet started.

Not all targets can be isolated. You can isolate only targets where AllowIsolate=yes is set in their unit files

[user@host ~]$ systemctl cat graphical.target
# /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target
...output omitted...
[Unit]
Description=Graphical Interface
Documentation=man:systemd.special(7)
Requires=multi-user.target
Wants=display-manager.service
Conflicts=rescue.service rescue.target
After=multi-user.target rescue.service rescue.target display-manager.service
AllowIsolate=yes

--------

SET A DEFAULT TARGET

When the system starts, the systemd unit activates the default.target target. Normally, the default target the /etc/systemd/system/ directory is a symbolic link to either the graphical.target or the multi-user.target targets. Instead of editing this symbolic link by hand, the systemctl command provides two subcommands to manage this link: get-default and set-default.

[root@host ~]# systemctl get-default
multi-user.target

[root@host ~]# systemctl set-default graphical.target
Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target -> /usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target.

[root@host ~]# systemctl get-default
graphical.target

--------

Select a Different Target at Boot Time
To select a different target at boot time, append the systemd.unit=target.target option to the kernel command line from the boot loader.

For example, to boot the system into a rescue shell where you can change the system configuration with almost no services running, append the following option to the kernel command line from the boot loader:

systemd.unit=rescue.target
This configuration change affects only a single boot, and is a useful tool to troubleshoot the boot process.

To use this method to select a different target, use the following procedure:

Boot or reboot the system.

Interrupt the boot loader menu countdown by pressing any key (except Enter, which would initiate a normal boot).

Move the cursor to the kernel entry to start.

Press e to edit the current entry.

Move the cursor to the line that starts with linux which is the kernel command line.

Append systemd.unit=target.target, for example, systemd.unit=emergency.target.

Press Ctrl+x to boot with these changes.
