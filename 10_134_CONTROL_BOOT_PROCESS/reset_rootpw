RESET ROOT PASSWORD AT BOOT

To reset a lost root password, you must use the rescue kernel.

To access that root shell, follow these steps:

1 Reboot the system.

2 Interrupt the boot-loader countdown by pressing any key, except Enter.

3 Move the cursor to the rescue kernel entry to boot (the entry with the "rescue" word in its name).

4 Press "E" to edit the selected entry.

5 Move the cursor to the kernel command line (the line that starts with linux).

6 Append "rd.break". With that option, the system breaks just before the system hands control from the initramfs image to the actual system.

7 Press Ctrl+x to boot with the changes.

8 Press Enter to perform maintenance when prompted.

At this point, the system presents a root shell, and the root file system on the disk is mounted read-only on /sysroot. Because troubleshooting often requires modifying the root file system, you must remount the root file system as read/write. The following step shows how the remount,rw option to the mount command remounts the file system where the new option (rw) is set.

Important 2nd part to RESET ROOT PASSWORD

To reset the root password, use the following procedure:

Remount /sysroot as read/write.

Enter the maintainence mode.

sh-5.1# mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
Switch into a chroot jail, where /sysroot is treated as the root of the file-system tree.

sh-5.1# chroot /sysroot
Set a new root password.

sh-5.1# passwd root
Ensure that all unlabeled files, including /etc/shadow at this point, get relabeled during boot.

sh-5.1# touch /.autorelabel

Then Type exit twice. The first command exits the chroot jail, and the second command exits the initramfs debug shell.

At this point, the system continues booting, performs a full SELinux relabeling, and then reboots again.
