RESET ROOT PASSWORD AT BOOT

To reset a lost root password, you must use the rescue kernel.

To access that root shell, follow these steps:

1 Reboot the system.

2 Interrupt the boot-loader countdown by pressing any key, except Enter.

3 Move the cursor to the rescue kernel entry to boot (the entry with the rescue word in its name).

4 Press e to edit the selected entry.

5 Move the cursor to the kernel command line (the line that starts with linux).

6 Append rd.break. With that option, the system breaks just before the system hands control from the initramfs image to the actual system.

7 Press Ctrl+x to boot with the changes.

8 Press Enter to perform maintenance when prompted.
